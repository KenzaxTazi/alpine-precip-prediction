# Alpine Precipitation Prediction

Application of probabilistic machine learning methods to predicting local alpine precipitation using large scale atmospheric data.

More information on the project website <www.alpine-precip-prediction.com>!

The scripts use ERA5 re-analysis data (see <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu>). You will need to create an account and a credentials file to use the API included in the code (see <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to>).

Please get in touch if you are interested in the areal masks I use.
